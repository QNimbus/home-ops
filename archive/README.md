# Archive Repository

This repository serves as a storage location for outdated, superseded, or inactive configurations and resources that were previously part of the active [home-ops infrastructure](https://github.com/qnimbus/home-ops/tree/main/kubernetes). Content is preserved here for reference purposes, potential future adaptation, or historical documentation.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The materials in this archive are not maintained by automated systems and should be considered inactive. They do not reflect the current operational environment.

## Purpose and Guidelines

This archive exists to:

- Preserve historical configurations and implementation approaches
- Maintain a backup of previously functional resources before removal
- Provide examples and reference materials for similar future implementations
- Support troubleshooting by comparing current configurations with previous versions

When archiving items, consider adding a brief note about when and why the resource was archived to provide context for future reference.
